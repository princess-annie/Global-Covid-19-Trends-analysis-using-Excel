# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This Project is a descriptive and exploratory data that shows an analysis on Covid-19 tracking the number of 
confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries overtime where we get key insights on what happened, when and how trends
changed.

# DATA SOURCE: 
The data was gotten from datahub.io and no data cleaning was required
but added extra columns for analysis

TOOL USED: Excel

The size of the dataset was
1. Total Records: 150,972 rows
2. Total Columns: 5 variables
3. Date Range: January, 2020 - December, 2022
4. Countries Covered: 187 unique countries/regions
5. Data Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

After cleaning the dataset
1. Total Records: 103,797 rows
2. Total Columns: 10 variables
3. Data Range: January, 2020 - August, 2021

The following charts were used to visualize the dataset Column chart, Bar chart,
Line chart to show the trend overtime, and Slicers to filter

KEY METRICS
- Real-time summary of total confirmed cases (190.1M), 
- recovered cases (126.5M),
- deaths (4.0M), 
- active cases (59.6M), 
- overall recovery rate (62.03%), 
- and case fatality rate (2.34%)

VISUALIZATIONS
1. USA had the most confirmed cases of covid-19 with 35.5 million cases

2. With The United States recorded the highest deaths with 611,143, which was 15.3% of all global deaths.
- Surprisingly, Mexico and Peru was the 4th highest in deaths even though it was not among the top 10 countries for confirmed cases.

3. Top 10 Countries by Active Cases
- The United States had 34.8 million active cases (58% of all active cases in the world).
- This was 98% of its total confirmed cases, which suggests that the United States stopped tracking how many people had recovered.

4. Top 10 Countries by Recovery Cases
- The United States did not appear in the top 10 for recoveries, even though it had the most confirmed cases.
- This is because the United States stopped recording recovery data.

5.Recovery Rate Trend Over Time
* In 2020, about 48.95% of patients recovered.
* By 2021, this number rose to 87.37%. This was an improvement of about 40%

6. Case Fatality Rate Trend Over time
* In 2020, about 1.73% of confirmed cases resulted in death.
* In 2021, this slightly dropped to 1.72%, which was only a small change.
